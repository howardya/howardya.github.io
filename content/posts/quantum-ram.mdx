RAM, random access memory, is an integral part of any modern computers. We have taken for granted how important RAM is in our daily lives and how easy it is to upgrade our RAM (of course cost is another factor).

A data scientist, data engineer, or quant will surely know that RAM is the first bottleneck in their work: If you cannot load all your data in, you simply have to invest extra time to streamline your analysis.

In the quantum world (quantum computers to be precise), 'RAM' is also an important tool and some of the quantum algorithms, which supposedly outperform best classical algorithm known, require the availability of the so called quantum RAM, **qRAM** in short. However, qRAM is very different when it comes to its functionalities and implementations.

In this article, we will first review how a classical RAM works. Then we will describe what are the additional requirements of qRAM. Finally we illustrate the difficulties in its implementations.

## Classical RAM

To understand how classical RAM works, it is instructive to consider the following cat example:

Suppose you have 8 cute cats, and you keep a note of which cat has been fed, and which is still hungry (poor cat). We shall use the notation as followed: $0$ indicates that the cat is hungry and $1$ indicates that the cat has been fed. For example, in the Figure 1 below, we can see which cats are have been fed (Cat 1/3/4/5/7) and which cats are hungry (Cat 2/6/8).

They are stored in RAM as binary data: RAM will assign an address to the location it stores the data

| Cats Index | Status | RAM Data | RAM Address |
| :--------: | :----: | :------: | :---------: |
|   Cat 1    |  Full  |    1     |    0x000    |
|   Cat 2    | Hungry |    0     |    0x001    |
|   Cat 3    |  Full  |    1     |    0x010    |
|   Cat 4    |  Full  |    1     |    0x011    |
|   Cat 5    |  Full  |    1     |    0x100    |
|   Cat 6    | Hungry |    0     |    0x101    |
|   Cat 7    |  Full  |    1     |    0x110    |
|   Cat 8    | Hungry |    0     |    0x111    |

Notice that I have also included the address pointing to the location where the RAM data of each cat is being stored.

## Classical RAM Retrieval

In order to retrieve the data, computer will let the RAM knows the address we are interested, and the RAM will retrieve the data. The way this works in practise is to use the _fanout_ algorithm \cite{circuitDesign}.

Suppose we are interested to get the status of Cat 7, which corresponds to the address $0x110$. In this case the only relevant information is the last 3 digits of the address, $110$.

As shown in Figure 2 below, the first binary digit will control the gate in the first level and it will allow transmission only to the right. The second digits will control _all_ the gates corresponding to the second level. In this case, all the Level 2 gates will also allow transmission only to the right. The third binary in the address will control the Level 3 gates and in this case, allowing only transmission to the left.

/>

Once the gates are configured correctly, it is then easy to retrieve the data from the corresponding address. Note that there are different implementations but _fanout_ algorithm is the most common implementaton.

## Problems Extending to Quantum Systems

The immediate question is how can we apply the same implementation in quantum computers. The short answer is it is difficult. Here are the reasons.

1. **Superposition** - In the classical RAM, there is always a unique address that we are interested in. Sure, we may want to find out what are the data stored in address 1, address 2, ... and so on, but the we will never _mix_ up query address 1 and address 2 together. In quantum computers, it is necessary to be able query a **superposition** of the quantum state in address 1 with the quantum state of address 2. For instance, we want the state $ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |0x001\rangle + |0x110\rangle  \right) $. There is no classical analogue to this.

2. **Decoherence** - Classical RAM can in principle store the data as long as its power is on. Quantum computers do not have such luxury because quantum systems are extremely delicate. Quantum memory will decohere (destroyed into unusable state) in a short time span. How short is the time scale we are talking? Miliseconds \cite{Miao1493}.

3. **Entanglement** - Entanglement is a double edged sword. It is a useful feature but it is also a pain to deal with. In the Figure 2 above, you may notice that the second bit of the address controls _all_ the gates at the second level. The number of gates at the $n^{th}$ level scales exponentially. In a quantum computer, this would mean that we need to interact exponentially many quantum objects and such interaction will create a massive entanglement between all the objects. This kind of system is extremely prone to decoherence.

## Quantum RAM

Despite the problems addressed above, there are advances in terms of algorithms and implementations. Here I illustrate the algorithm called **bucket-brigade** quantum RAM \cite{qramPRL,qramPRA}.

To simplify the notations, I shall reduce the levels to only two levels. Thus the addresses can only be one of the following ${0x00,0x01,0x10,0x11}$. Inside the quantum RAM, holds the information, which in this quantum states. The following table provides a summary.

|              Address              |                 States                 |
| :-------------------------------: | :------------------------------------: |
| $\left\vert0x00\right\rangle_{A}$ | $\left\vert Cat_{00}\right\rangle_{M}$ |
| $\left\vert0x01\right\rangle_{A}$ | $\left\vert Cat_{01}\right\rangle_{M}$ |
| $\left\vert0x10\right\rangle_{A}$ | $\left\vert Cat_{10}\right\rangle_{M}$ |
| $\left\vert0x11\right\rangle_{A}$ | $\left\vert Cat_{11}\right\rangle_{M}$ |

The subscripts $A$ and $M$ here are to distinguish the systems from address vs memory states.

However, remember that we have a quantum computer: thus, any _linear combination_ of the addresses are also valid. For example, a user can specify the following valid address:

$$
\alpha_{00} \left|0x00\right\rangle_{A} + \alpha_{11} \left|0x11\right\rangle_{A}
$$

where $\left|\alpha_{00}\right|^2 + |\alpha_{11}\vert^2 = 1$. The quantum computer, together with quantum RAM, should return the user the following states:

$$
\alpha_{00}
\left|0x00\right\rangle_{A}
\left|Cat_{00}\right\rangle_{M}
+
\alpha_{11}
\left|0x11\right\rangle_{A}
\left|Cat_{11}
\right\rangle_{M}
$$

## Quantum RAM Retrieval Process

To understand the idea behind the retrieval from a quantum RAM, the authors proposed that we first prepare our quantum RAM in the following states as shown in the figure below. The circles refer to a switch is initially in the off state.

<Image
	fileName="quantum-ram/figure-3-BB-step1.png"
	className="small-image"
	alt="Figure 3: Initialization of quantum RAM."
/>

We then sequentially send the quantum address from _top to bottom_, one qubit by one qubit. To understand the process, it is good to start with simple cases.

### A. Classical address in quantum RAM

Suppose we interested to retrieve the quantum state $\left|Cat_{11}\right\rangle_{M}$, we should send in the address $\left|
0x{\color{red}{1}}{\color{green}{1}}
\right\rangle_{A}$. What happens is that we will send in the address one by one (they are really just qubit) starting from the first qubit (highlighted as <span style="color:red">red</span>) then the second qubit (highlighted as <span style="color:green">green</span>). This is illustrated in Figure 3 below.

<Image
	fileName="quantum-ram/figure-3-BB-simple.png"
	className="small-image"
	alt="Figure 3: Retrieval of classical address using quantum RAM."
/>

1. Step 1: We send in the first qubit to interact with the first switch, since the switch is off state, it will then interact with the first qubit which is in the state $\color{red}{1}$, and remember that $1$ means transmission to the right.
2. Step 2: We then send in the second qubit. By this time, the first switch has already interacted with first qubit, it will simply direct the second qubit to the right, and down to the switch on the lower right. Since that switch is in the off state, it will then interact with the second qubit, which is in state $\color{green}{1}$ and opens up pathway to the right.
3. Step 3: We then send in an empty state down the pathway. This empty quantum state, $\left|\cdot\right\rangle_{M}$ will flow down all the way and reaches the memory housing the desired quantum state $\left|Cat_{11}\right\rangle_{M}$. Then the memory state can be coherently transfered to the empty state.

### B. Quantum address in quantum RAM

Let's see what happens when we specify a quantum address $\alpha_{00} \left|0x{\color{red}{0}}0\right\rangle_{A} + \alpha_{11} \left|0x{\color{red}{1}}1\right\rangle_{A}$.
Let's send the first qubit (highlighted in red) into the quantum RAM. (Remember that even though there are two terms in the equation, there is really just one qubit encoding the first address, it is in suporposition!)

When the first qubit reaches the first switch, the quantum switch is unable to deterministically open up pathway to the right nor to the right because the qubit is not in a deterministic state of either $0$ or $1$. So, the switch will _open up both pathway_. This is the interesting features of quantum physics. However, the switch will open up the pathway to both directions in a way that preserve quantum coherence (that is until decoherence kicks in).

<Image
	fileName="quantum-ram/figure-4-BB-quantum-first-qubit.png"
	className="small-image"
	alt="Figure 3: Retrieval of quantum address using quantum RAM. Only the first qubit is sent in."
/>

Now we send in the second qubit. Which way will the second qubit travel? The answer is both. Otherwise, ask for refund. In the figure below, we use transparent arrows to show that qubit branch out into both directions but in a coherent manner. The wave function of the second qubit that reaches the switch at the bottom left, will interact with it but this time, it only open up the pathway to the left, which is the memory state $\left|Cat_{00}\right\rangle_{M}$. This is because we do not have any weight to the address $\left|0x01\right\rangle_{A}$.

On the other hand (or in a parallel universe), the wave function of the qubit that reaches the switch at the bottom right will interact with the switch and opens up the pathway only to the right.

	className="small-image"
	alt="Figure 3: Retrieval of quantum address using quantum RAM. After second qubit is sent in."
/>

Finally, we send in the empty qubit through the pathway and it will reach both the $\left|Cat_{00}\right\rangle_{M}$ and $\left|Cat_{11}\right\rangle_{M}$. The empty qubit will then capture the memory quantum states and travel back to the starting point. The end result will be exactly what we wanted.

$$
\alpha_{00}
\left|0x00\right\rangle_{A}
\left|Cat_{00}\right\rangle_{M}
+
\alpha_{11}
\left|0x11
\right\rangle_{A}
\left|Cat_{11}
\right\rangle_{M}
$$

## Final Remark

I hope you have gained a basic understanding of the problems and difficulties in implementing quantum RAM in a quantum computer. The ability to prepare and retrieve quantum states using the above qRAM algotirhm is essential for many algorithms \cite{Rebentrost_2018}.

Even though we are still some distance away from quantum computer, I do look forward to the day data scientists, data engineer and quants and program and code in the language of quantum computing.
