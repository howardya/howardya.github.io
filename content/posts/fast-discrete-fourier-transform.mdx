Fourier transform (FT) is perhaps one of the most important mathematical tool in the modern digital world today. It is used by digital devices to decode and encode digital signals whenever we stream Youtube, listen to music, make a call. (Un)surprisingly, it is also the core mathematical tools in quantum physics, giving rise to the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle" target="_blank">Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle</a>.

There are a few variants or implementations of Fourier transform such as discrete Fourier transform and fast Fourier transform. Their differences are subtle and can be quite confusing.

In this article, I would like to give an introduction and clarification to the differences between the them, in particular:
1. Fourier Transform (FT)
2. Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT)
3. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
4. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

## Fourier Transform (FT)

Fourier transform (FT) is the theoretical framework behind *all variants* of Fourier transform, it is thus essential to understand it in order to understand it first. 

FT can be understood in multiple ways: first of all, it is a convenient and useful tool to analyze *any* continuous function (not necessarily signals in the engineering context) from a different perspectives. When you think of music, you may think of them as (vibrations) amplitude across the time domain, or you may think of it as frequency distributions. They are the same but offer deeper insights: two sides of the same coin. In fact, the wave-particle duality in quantum physics is a consequence of such performing measures in space that is dual to one another.

 A sine wave for example, displayed as a sinusoidal change in the aplitude in time domain, is nonetheless a very well defined function in the frequeny domain: it has a fixed frequency and thus displays as a fixed deterministic point in the frequency domain distribution. Fourier transform aims to connect the amplitude distributions in these two spaces.

The mathematical definition of Fourier transform, is given as followed:
$$
\color{blue}{\mathcal{F}(p) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty dx \; f(x) e^{-ipx}}
$$
where the original function $f(x)$ on the space of $x$ has been transformed into its dual space, $p$ and the distribution on the dual space is given by $\mathcal{F}(p)$. 

The physical meaning of $x$ and $p$ depends on the context. They can be the position-momentum (physics) or time-frequency (engineering). The transform can be reversed through the inverse Fourier transform defined by:
$$
\color{blue}{f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty dp \; \mathcal{F}(p) e^{ipx}}
$$

## Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT)

Once we are comfortable with FT, the next natural idea is DTFT, as opposed to DFT. Discrete time Fourier transform, as the name suggests, caters to signals which are discretely recorded in the time domain, at fixed intervals, mimicking how real world signals would have been measured and taken. However, even though the inputs to DTFT are discrete, the outputs in the frequency domain are continuous - thus the *discrete-time* name. 

To illustrate the disreteness in the time domain, consider the original function $f(x)$ which is sampled discretely, at a fixed interval $\Delta_x$. This can be represented using Dirac's distribution as
$$
f^{DT}(x) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \delta(x-n\Delta_x)
$$

Once we have the representation of the above signals, we can then apply the standard Fourier transform to the above discrete version of $f(x)$ to obtain
$$
\mathcal{F}^{DTFT}(p) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty dx \; f^{DT}(x) e^{-ipx}
$$
$$
\mathcal{F}^{DTFT}(p) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty dx \; \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \delta(x-n\Delta_x) e^{-ipx}
$$
$$
\color{blue}{\mathcal{F}^{DTFT}(p) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} f(n\Delta_x) e^{-ipn\Delta_x}}
$$
The last equation is then the definition of DTFT. Note that it is a continuous function of $p$, even though the inputs are discrete.

One interesting thing to note is that if $\Delta_x = \Delta'$, that is it is independent of $x$, then the DTFT is periodic by nature. This can be seen easily by noticing that
$$
\mathcal{F}^{DTFT}(p) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} f(n\Delta') e^{-ipn\Delta'} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} f(n\Delta') e^{-in\Delta'(p + \frac{2\pi}{\Delta'} k)} = \mathcal{F}^{DTFT}(p + \frac{2\pi}{\Delta'} k)
$$
where $k$ is any integers. The periodicity is thus $\frac{2\pi}{\Delta'}$.

The intuition is that in DTFT, we have discarded a large chunks of information in our original time domain function, and in the frequency domain, it means that we only need to specify the frequency amplitude for one period. The length of the period depends on the gap $\Delta'$.

> The bigger the gap $\Delta'$ is, the more information we are ignoring in the time domain. Thus we need to specify smaller information in the frequency domain, and this is reflected by the smaller period $\frac{2\pi}{\Delta'}$ in the frequency domain.

The inverse of DTFT is given by 
$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty dp \; \mathcal{F}^{DTFT}(p) e^{ipx}
$$
Due to the periodicity of $\mathcal{F}^{DTFT}(p)$, it can also be written equivalently as
$$
\color{blue}{f(n\Delta') = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{0}^{\frac{2\pi}{\Delta'}} dp \; \mathcal{F}^{DTFT}(p) e^{ipn\Delta'}}
$$

## Discrete Fourier Transform

In the previous section, the DTFT of a discrete version is a continuous function in the frequency domain. While it is good to capture the continuous behaviour in the frequency domain, it is not practical for computer to deal with continuous function.

Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is another variant such that it takes in finite discrete inputs in the time domain and output finite discrete outputs in the frequency domain, so that computers can work efficiently on it.

Three changes we are going to make:
1. Assume that the sampling is only done at finite number of $N$ points, corresponding to $\Delta, 2\Delta,\ldots,N\Delta$. Thus we have $f^{D}(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} f(x) \delta(x-n\Delta)$.
2. Assume that the sampled data in the time domain is periodic outside the range from $\Delta$ to $N\Delta$. Thus $f^{D}(x + N\Delta) = f^{D}(x)$. With this assumption, we can extend the function to infinite sums again, $f^{D}(x) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \delta(x-n\Delta)$. We only need to note that $f(x+N\Delta) = f(x)$.
3. Recall that discreteness in the time domain implies that the frequency domain function is periodic. Similar, a periodic time domain function will imply discreteness in the frequency domain.
4. Periodic and discreteness in the frequency domain means that we need only to keep finite number of terms.

Let us derive how Fourier transform of the function $f^{D}(x)$ looks like.
$$
\mathcal{F}^{DFT}(p) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty dx \; f^{D}(x) e^{-ipx}
$$
$$
\mathcal{F}^{DFT}(p) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty dx \; \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \delta(x-n\Delta) e^{-ipx}
$$
$$
\mathcal{F}^{DFT}(p) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} f(n\Delta) e^{-ipn\Delta}
$$

In the last equations, we can replace the single summation with a double summations
$$
\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} F(n) \rightarrow \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{m=-\infty}^\infty F(n+mN)
$$
Thus, we have
$$
\mathcal{F}^{DFT}(p) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \sum_{m=-\infty}^\infty f(n\Delta + mN\Delta) e^{-ipn\Delta}e^{-ipmN\Delta}
$$
However, we have $f(n\Delta + mN\Delta) = f(n\Delta)$, due to the periodicity as described in the second point above.
$$
\mathcal{F}^{DFT}(p) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \sum_{n=1}^{N} f(n\Delta)e^{-ipn\Delta} \sum_{m=-\infty}^\infty  e^{-ipmN\Delta}
$$
$$
\mathcal{F}^{DFT}(p) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \sum_{n=1}^{N} f(n\Delta)e^{-ipn\Delta} \frac{2\pi}{N\Delta} \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(p-l \frac{2\pi}{N\Delta})
$$
The second equation above is due to the identity below, which can be found at <a target="_blank" href="http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e102/lectures/ExponentialDelta.pdf">here</a>. (The pdf can also be downloaded <a href={diracDeltaExponentialFile} download>here</a>)
$$
\frac{1}{F} \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-i2\pi mf/F} = \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(f-lF)
$$

To simplify the equation further, notice that the Fourier transform $\mathcal{F}^{DFT}(p)$ is periodic with period $\frac{2\pi}{\Delta}$. Thus we only need to know the values for $\mathcal{F}^{DFT}(p)$ from, say, $0$ to $\frac{2\pi}{\Delta}$. Combined this with the fact we have a discrete Dirac delta functions, it is obvious that we only need the $N$ values $\mathcal{F}^{DFT}(p)$ where $p=\frac{2\pi}{N\Delta}, 2\frac{2\pi}{N\Delta},\ldots,N\frac{2\pi}{N\Delta}$. These discrete values are given by
$$
\color{blue}{\mathcal{F}^{DFT}(k\frac{2\pi}{N\Delta}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \frac{2\pi}{N\Delta} \sum_{n=1}^{N} f(n\Delta)e^{-i k2\pi\frac{n}{N}}, \;\;\; k=1,2,\ldots,N}
$$

The inverse of DFT can be derived equivalently by the same logic as above. However, a simpler equivalent relationship can be observed as followed. This is the Fourier transform identity we have painstakingly derived abovee:
$$
f^{D}(x) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \delta(x-n\Delta) \;\;\; \xrightarrow{DFT} \;\;\; \mathcal{F}^{DFT}(k\frac{2\pi}{N\Delta}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \frac{2\pi}{N\Delta} \sum_{n=1}^{N} f(n\Delta)e^{-i k2\pi\frac{n}{N}}
$$

If we now make the following mapping: $x$ changed to $p$, $\Delta$ changed to $\frac{2\pi}{N\Delta}$, $i$ changed to $-i$, then immediately can see that following inverse DFT:
$$
F^{DFT}(p) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} f(p) \delta(p-n\frac{2\pi}{N\Delta}) \;\;\; \xrightarrow{\text{inverse}\; DFT}     \;\;\; f(k\Delta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \Delta \sum_{n=1}^{N} F^{DFT}(n\frac{2\pi}{N\Delta})e^{i k2\pi\frac{n}{N}}
$$

Note that in some literatures, you may see the notation $f(n\Delta) \rightarrow x_n$ used. Furthermore, the coefficients in front may be missing. However, they are consistent. There is some arbitrariness in terms of how we define Fourier transform. The utmost important thing is that after one round of Fourier transform and followed by inverse Fourier transform, we retrieve the original data. It does not matter so much the whether we put all the coefficients in the first step or the second step.




## Fast Fourier Transform

Alright, phew, that was an intense exercise. How about FFT then? Conceptually, FFT is similar to DFT. The real difference is with the way it is being calculated. In the formulation above, note that we have $N$ discrete values. The output of DFT is also a set of $N$ values in the frequency domain. However, to calculate each of the $N$ value in the frequency domain, we need to perform multiplication $N$ times. Thus, in total, we require $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ computations. 

FFT aims to speed up these computations, by reducing the $N^2$ calculations into $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$, a dramatic increase in the computation speed!

Most of us likely will not need to know the exact algorithm to use FFT.
